To build this project you must have Java 8 on your path. Then clone this repo then navigate to the cloned directory and run `gradlew build` on Windows CMD or `./gradlew build` in terminal on MacOS and Linux. If this doesn't work you may need to install gradle from https://gradle.org/releases. Next run gradle wrapper in the cloned directory and finally the original `gradlew build` or `./gradlew build`.
